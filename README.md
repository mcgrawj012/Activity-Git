Who am I?
Hey my name is John McGraw. I am currently a personal trainer who is looking for a career change. Recently went back to Brookdale Community College to finish my A.S Business degree where I also took java coding classes and SQL classes. I plan on transfering to Rutgers University to finish a B.A in Business Administation with a concentration in data analytics. I chose FinTech because it combines two of my areas of interest.
